# OMDB Api 
###### Martin Coleman, G00312351
Fourth Year Mobile Apps Project 

## Introduction
The idea for this project was to create a windows universal apps project that implements MVVM. I decided to use the OMDB Api to search for movies and display the information about the movies.
I also decided to use local storage to allow users to store movies.

## MVVM
Model-view View-model
MVVM separates the responsibility for the appearance and layout of the UI from the responsibility for the presentation logic.

###Model
The model represents the data we are dealing with.

###View 
The view is what the end user sees and interacts with.

##Viewmodel 
The Viewmodel connects the Model to the View.
It allows for loose coupling and binding of data.

## Local Storage

## Json.Net 
I used in this project as it handles serialisation and deserialisation very well.
I use it to convert my Movie model classes into Json Strings for saving to local to local storage.
